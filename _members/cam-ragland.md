Cam Ragland (she/her) is the Lab Manager at QMEL, where she facilitates research operations and fosters a collaborative lab community. She is passionate about supporting research that bridges ecological solutions with management strategies and quantitative applications.

Cam earned her bachelor's degree in environmental science and geology from Union College in 2022. After graduating, she worked as a marine technician at Sea Education Association, where she taught undergraduate students marine science field sampling techniques while sailing a tall ship at sea. She then joined UNH's Shoals Marine Lab, an island field station in the Gulf of Maine. At Shoals, she coordinated program planning and research facilitation for marine science field courses. Living and working on an offshore island deepened her appreciation for the intersection of fieldwork, education, and community building in marine science.

In her free time, Cam enjoys combining her loves of art and science through ceramics and watercolor painting, knitting, and spending time on the water.
