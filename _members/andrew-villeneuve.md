Andrew (Drew) Villeneuve (he/him/his) is a global change marine ecologist working across scales of biological organization to better understand the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems and the people that depend on them. He specifically seeks to combine empirical data of organismal physiology and distribution, environmental, and extreme event data into models of population dynamics under climate change. Current projects include modeling how heat stress accumulates in the eastern Oyster during tidal cycles, describing intertidal microhabitat patterns, and modeling survival of long-term heatwaves on Mediterranean coral species. 

Andrew earned his bachelor’s in Biology from Bowdoin College in 2016 and his master’s in Environmental Conservation from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2021. At UMass Amherst, he worked in the Marine Global Change Ecology lab with Dr. Brian Cheng understanding the role of local adaptation in driving intraspecific trait variation and climate sensitivity of the marine predatory gastropod Urosalpinx cinerea. He was a 2021 Knauss Marine Policy Fellow with NOAA Fisheries, where he supported efforts to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge from Inuit groups into an international agreement to prevent unregulated fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean, and developed communication materials about NOAA Fisheries surveys for the public and Congress. 

When not working on his research, Andrew likes to spend his time outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, diving, getting lost, and [taking nature walks](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1160923).
